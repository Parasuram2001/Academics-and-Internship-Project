The SBI.csv dataset contains the information of more than 2300 children that attended the emergency services with fever and were tested for serious bacterial infection. The outcome sbi has 4 categories: Not Applicable(no infection) / UTI / Pneum / Bact

Build a multinomial model using wcc, age, prevAB, pct, and crp to predict sbi

Compute the confusion matrix and compute the kappa statistics

How does the model classify a child with 1 year of age, WCC=29, PCT=5, CRP=200 and no prevAB?


The file SBI.csv contains 2349 records of children admitted to the emergency room with fever and tested for serious bacterial infection (sbi). The following variables are included :
